+++Some Basics:-
"~" -> Home directory
"/" -> Root directory
"su" -> used to switch to root user 
"su username" -> used to switch to different user
"sudo" -> executes commands with root/super user privilages

++++++++ LS +++++++++
=>NOTE:: These commands can also be combined works for all commands below
=>Example:: -la 
ls -d */ -> shows only directories
ls -l -> with ownerSettings, permissions, timestamp
ls -a -> show hidden contents
ls -author -> shows along with the user
ls -S -> sorts and list all the content in specified directory by size
ls *.txt -> shows with specific format
ls -IS > file.txt -> copies result of ls in  a text file 
find /path/to/folder -name '*bat*' //find file with certain file name

++++++++ CAT +++++++++
Used to show contents of text file and concatenate several files into one

cat > file.txt -> used to create and write in a new file
cat >> file.txt -> append text to a existing file from the terminal
cat -b -> list number of lines but not blank lines
cat -n -> numbers the lines and list number of lines but it also do for blank lines
cat -s -> compresses multiple blank lines into one

++++++++ GREP +++++++++
to search for a particular string in a text file

grep findthis file.txt -> return result for matching characters "findthis"
grep -i findthis file.txt -> return result for matching case insensitive string "findthis"
grep -n findthis file.txt -> result along with their line number
grep -v findthis file.txt -> result of lines not matching the search string
grep -c findthis file.txt -> result a number ( of times matched the search string)
ls | egrep '\.txt' ->shows only text files

++++++++ SORT +++++++++
to sort the result 
sort file.txt
sort -r file.txt -> in reverse order
sort -f file.txt -> case insensitive order

++++++++ | (pipe command) +++++++++
used to input the result of one command as input to another command

grep dh file.txt file2.txt | sort -> search 'dh' from both files then sorts them


++++++++ CP [flag] source destination +++++++++
copies file/directory 
cp -n -> will not overwrite the file
cp -u -> updates when only when source file is diff from destination file
cp -r -> for directory copying. 

++++++++ MV [flag] source destination +++++++++
mv moves the directory or to rename
mv file1 file2
mv -u file1 directory -> move only if Source File Is Newer Than the Destination
sudo mv /home/vivek/app1/ /var/www/html/ -> one folder to another


++++++++ MKDIR +++++++++
mkdir -> create new dir
mkdir -p f1/f2/f3 -> folder k andr folder k andr folder
mkdir -p f1/{f2,f3,f4} -> folder k andr 3 folder
mkdir {f1,f2,f3} -> create mult. folders


++++++++ RM & RMDIR +++++++++
rmdir -> removes the specifies directory
rmdir -p -> remove both parent and child dir
rm -r -> removes even non-empty dir
rm -rp -> removes even non-empty dir inlcuding parent and subdir


++++++++ WORKING WITH USER PERMISSIONS +++++++++
r-read, w-write, x-execute

Denotions:
users -> 'u'
groups -> 'g'
others -> 'o'
all -> 'a'

file types:
normal file -> '-'
directory -> 'd'
character special file -> 'c'
binary special file -> 'b' 

defined below --> drwxrwxr-x

     user 		group		other's
     permissions	permissions	permissions
d    r w x 		r w x 		r - x
| 
f
i
l
e

t
y
p
e


+++++++ CHMOD +++++++
used to change the access permissions of files and directories
instead of using + and - we can replace that with '=' sign which replaces it.	
->chmod g+wx filename
->chmod u=wrx,o-wx filename

+++++++ CHOWN +++++++
used to change the owner of files and directories
->chown username filename
->chown username:grpname filename //changes both owner and grp ownership of a particular file

+++++++ CHGRP +++++++
used to change the group ownership of files and directories
chgrp grpname filename //change grp ownership of a file


++++++++++++++++++
+++ TAR FILES UNZIP / ZIP ++
++++++++++++++++++
Tar is used to compress and decompress a file
- tar -cvf tar-file-name-to-be file-name
- tar -xvf tar-file-name 
- tar -xf archive.tar.gz
	

+++++++++++++++++++++
+++ creating users ++
+++++++++++++++++++++

sudo useradd username //create a new user
sudo passwd username //setup password for that user
sudo userdel username //delete that particular user

sudo groupadd grpname 
sudo groupdel grpname
sudo usermod -g grpname username // add a user to a grp	


++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
wc helps to find word count > letter word lines
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
Sort sorts the input '-r' in reverse
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
Uniq omits the same word and prints the uniq only if in sorted order | we have the same in sort which is sort  -u
uniq -d prints only duplicates 
uniq -u which prints only the non-duplicate lines
uniq -c counts the duplicates
example 'sort flavours.txt | uniq -c (counts the same words) | sort -nr (prints it in reverse numerically sorted)
